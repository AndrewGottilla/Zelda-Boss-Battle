This project was made for my CS50x course. This Scratch project is a small Legend of Zelda themed boss battle. It is reminiscent of old-school internet flash games, which were short, addicting, and instantly replayable. The boss starts with 10 health. As the boss takes more damage, he becomes quicker. You (Link) have only 3 health. You'll have to be a little smart about your swipes. Once the game is over, i.e. if Link or the boss loses, the game will restart to the title screen. I believe that this project has more potential than content. I believe that this could be very easily expanded upon; more levels, new enemies and archetypes, enemy spawning, new weapons, and so much more!
